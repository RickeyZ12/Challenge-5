# Task Manager Board
## created a site that allows users to track their tasks.
## When you press add task, a popup comes up, allowing users to give the task a name and description.
## The pop up will also allows users to choose a date (with day.js API), indicating which category the task goes into.
# Future Development
## I couldn't get the tasks to actually come up when you save the task.
## So I couldnt test if the tasks were draggable or not.
# Will try and fix them up so the tasks actually show.
